    Pandora Travel Co. has branches in almost every nook and corner of the world and with $20 billion
transactions globally, every down time results in massive losses. Multiple developers are working from
remote locations and are having trouble coordinating with each other. The code deployment ratio is
100:10, hence the developers need a robust Source Control Management System with strong branching
and merging features. Git suits their needs perfectly.
